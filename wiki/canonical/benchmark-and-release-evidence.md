# Benchmark And Release Evidence

## TL;DR

- 성능/효과 측정은 end-user CLI workflow가 아니라 maintainer release evidence workflow다.
- 현재 maintainer benchmark의 목적은 프로젝트를 개발/업데이트하면서 사용자에게 “targeted retrieval 방식이 naive full-wiki scan 대비 어느 정도의 Markdown context 추정 입력량을 피하는지”, “얼마나 빠르게 필요한 정보를 읽는지”, “이전 버전보다 얼마나 좋아졌는지”를 객관적 수치로 설명하는 것이다. 이는 실제 LLM 토큰 사용량 측정이 아니다.
- 실제 LLM 기준 벤치마크가 필요할 때는 OpenAI API/Codex JSONL 계측처럼 실제 `input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `reasoning_output_tokens`, wall-clock latency, tokens/sec, request count, model, service tier, cost 계산 근거를 수집하는 별도 benchmark surface로 다뤄야 한다.
- Codex 실제값 benchmark는 소/중/대 규모 wiki 및 codebase에서 Project Librarian을 적용한 조건과 적용하지 않은 control 조건을 비교해야 한다. 실제 coding agent에게 요청할 법한 과업을 재현하고 token usage, elapsed time, first-token/turn timing, tool-call count, command count, retrieved evidence count, correctness를 함께 측정해야 한다.
- 측정 harness는 docs-heavy wiki, monorepo wiki, scoped-router wiki, code-heavy mixed JS/TS/TSX/Go/Python/Rust/Java/PHP/Kotlin/Swift/C/C++/C#/config index 시나리오와 optional Tree-sitter index 시나리오로 구성된 large-project benchmark suite를 만든다.
- 명시적 `--sample-repo <path>`를 반복해서 주면 synthetic suite에 실제 로컬 repository 복사본 검증 시나리오들을 추가한다. 이 값들은 해당 repo들에 대한 관찰 근거이며 기본 synthetic release claim과 구분한다.
- 개선 릴리스는 benchmark baseline과 current report의 delta를 함께 제시해야 한다.
- Public README는 benchmark 명령 사용법을 사용자가 따라 할 workflow처럼 전면에 두지 말고, 최신 maintainer report의 결과값, 측정 조건, dirty/clean source-control boundary, claimable/unstable status를 먼저 보여줘야 한다. “estimated token avoidance” 표현은 실제 LLM token 사용량이 아니라 Markdown character 기반 context-size estimate임을 가까운 문맥에서 명시해야 한다.

## Current Benchmark Surface

Code-backed current behavior:

- Maintainer benchmark command is `npm run benchmark`, backed by `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`. Evidence: `package.json`, `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.
- Shared benchmark validation primitives live under `benchmarks/lib/validation.js` so scenario checks are not only embedded in the main metrics runner. Evidence: `benchmarks/lib/validation.js`, `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.
- Release baseline command is `npm run benchmark:baseline`, which writes a versioned JSON baseline and Markdown summary under `benchmarks/`. Evidence: `package.json`, `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.
- Release gate command is `npm run benchmark:release -- --baseline <baseline.json> --out <report.json>`, which requires a clean checkout, writes Markdown, and fails unless the comparison is release-claimable. Evidence: `package.json`, `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.
- CI benchmark smoke command is `npm run benchmark:ci-smoke`, which builds the CLI and runs a quick benchmark with the standard sample set, 1 discarded warmup run, and 2 measured runs. Evidence: `package.json`, `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`.
- Trend report command is `npm run benchmark:trend -- --trend <report-a.json> --trend <report-b.json> ...`, which writes direction-aware JSON/Markdown trend summaries. Evidence: `package.json`, `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.
- The benchmark is not exposed as a public `project-librarian` CLI flag. Evidence: `src/args.ts`, `src/init-project-wiki.ts`.
- The default benchmark scale creates large project fixtures in a temporary directory, runs the built CLI, and emits JSON. Evidence: `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.
- Benchmark schema v9 records repeated-run measurement metadata, discarded warmup count, measurement protocol, claimable/unstable timing metrics, scenario validation checks, timing dispersion stats, environment fingerprint, source-control fingerprint, sample repo content fingerprints, scenario-set compatibility, baseline regression status, targeted-context estimated-token avoidance, scoped-router generation metrics, retrieval correctness, code-evidence correctness, default and Tree-sitter code-index timing, parser-profile coverage, subprocess-overhead estimates, and baseline manifest metadata. Evidence: `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.
- The standard sample repo set lives under `benchmarks/samples/`: `web-service` for JS/TS/config/package-dependency route coverage, `python-cli` for library/tooling-shaped Python/config coverage, and `mixed-monorepo` for apps/packages/services-shaped mixed JS/TS/Python/Go/config coverage. Evidence: `benchmarks/samples/`, `tests/smoke.sh`.
- Smoke tests use `--quick` only to validate report shape; CI uses quick scale for benchmark integrity smoke coverage; public release claims should use the default large scale. Evidence: `tests/smoke.sh`, `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`, `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`.
- The benchmark can write a current report with `--out <path>`, compare against a previous report with `--baseline <path>`, save a baseline with `--save-baseline [path]`, write a Markdown summary with `--markdown [path]`, repeat measurements with `--runs <n>`, discard warmup measurements with `--warmup-runs <n>`, require a clean git checkout with `--require-clean`, add one or more explicit local repository validation scenarios with repeated `--sample-repo <path>`, and fail CI on release-gate problems with `--fail-on-regression`. Evidence: `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`.

## Metrics Contract

Required release-evidence metrics:

| Metric | Meaning | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compact_context.estimated_tokens` | Estimated tokens for `wiki/startup.md` plus `wiki/index.md`. | Measures session-start context cost, not full task context. |
| `targeted_context.estimated_tokens` | Estimated tokens for `wiki/startup.md`, `wiki/index.md`, and the query-returned target document. | Models a targeted lookup more honestly than startup/index-only context. |
| `full_wiki.estimated_tokens` | Estimated tokens for all wiki markdown files in the fixture. | Measures the naive full-scan baseline avoided by read-on-demand routing. |
| `savings.estimated_token_avoidance_percent` | Percent estimated-token avoidance from targeted context vs full wiki read, using `ceil(characters / 4)`. | Supports only context-efficiency claims, not measured LLM tokenizer or API token-consumption claims. |
| `startup_index_only_upper_bound` | Upper-bound savings from startup/index-only context vs full wiki read. | Prevents the benchmark from presenting startup/index-only savings as the default task-context estimate. |
| `retrieval_strategy_comparison` | Full wiki scan, startup/index-only, and targeted query-result context size plus expected-evidence status. | Makes the old startup/index-only comparison visible as an upper-bound that misses task evidence. |
| `retrieval_correctness` | Query text, expected file, whether query returned the expected file, and whether targeted context contains it. | Ensures context-efficiency is tied to a successful lookup, not just fewer characters. |
| `targeted_context.avg_read_ms` and `full_wiki.avg_read_ms` | Local filesystem read timing over repeated reads. | Supports targeted retrieval vs full-scan read-time claims. |
| `savings.read_time_reduction_percent` | Read-time reduction from targeted context vs full wiki scan. | Measures practical targeted-lookup speed benefit. |
| `bootstrap_create_ms` | Time to create a fresh wiki. | Guards baseline bootstrap performance. |
| `doctor_ms` | Time to run diagnostics over the synthetic large wiki. | Guards lifecycle diagnostic scalability. |
| `query_ms` | Time to search the synthetic large wiki. | Guards project wiki lookup responsiveness. |
| `scoped_refresh_index_ms`, `scoped_router_count`, `scoped_main_index_chars`, and `scoped_target_router_chars` | Time and size checks for generated scoped routers under `wiki/indexes/auto-*.md`. | Proves monorepo route splitting keeps `wiki/index.md` compact while preserving navigable target evidence. |
| `code_index_ms` and `code_index_files_per_second` | Time and throughput for a full synthetic mixed JS/TS/TSX/Go/Python/polyglot/config code evidence index. | Guards large-repo code evidence scalability across representative local file kinds. |
| `incremental_index_ms`, `incremental_reindexed_files`, and `incremental_deleted_files` | Time and touched-file counts for changed-file code evidence updates. | Supports incremental-index improvement claims. |
| `full_to_incremental_time_reduction_percent` | Percent wall-clock reduction from full code index to incremental rerun in the fixture. | Quantifies large-repo update-loop improvement. |
| `architecture_report_ms`, `architecture_report_sections`, `architecture_report_evidence_tables`, `architecture_report_routes`, and `architecture_report_dependencies` | Time and content coverage for `--code-report` architecture/ownership summaries from the generated code evidence index. | Supports large-project architecture/ownership report claims while blocking empty-report timing claims. |
| `architecture_report_language_profiles` and code-heavy assumptions for generated test, Go, Python, Rust, Java, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, C, C++, C#, lockfile, config, and ignored files | Coverage of mixed source/config/profile realism in the synthetic code fixture. | Prevents the code-heavy benchmark from proving only a clean TypeScript-only path. |
| `tree_sitter_code_index_ms`, `tree_sitter_code_files`, `tree_sitter_parser_profiles`, and `tree_sitter_parser_profile_names` | Time, file coverage, and parser-profile coverage for optional Tree-sitter indexing over the same synthetic code fixture. | Supports parser-backend coverage claims without mixing optional-parser cost into the default code-index metric. |
| code-heavy `evidence_correctness` | Exact SQL lookup correctness for a generated route and dependency row. | Ensures code-index timing corresponds to retrievable evidence that a user task would need. |
| `node_subprocess_overhead_ms` and `*_operation_estimated_ms` | Rough Node CLI process startup overhead and elapsed-minus-overhead diagnostics. | Separates end-to-end CLI timing from approximate operation timing without weakening release gates. |
| `sample_repo_count`, `sample_repo_code_index_ms`, `sample_repo_code_files`, `sample_repo_architecture_report_ms`, `sample_repo_architecture_report_routes`, `sample_repo_architecture_report_dependencies`, and scenario-level `sample_repo_profile` | Optional validation metrics for copied local repositories passed through repeated `--sample-repo`. | Adds actual repository evidence while keeping the claim boundary tied to those explicit paths and repo shapes. |
| scenario confidence labels | Claim boundary for docs-heavy, monorepo, and code-heavy scenarios. | Prevents overclaiming from one fixture type. |
| `measurement.runs`, `measurement.warmup_runs`, `measurement.measurement_protocol`, `measurement.timing_status`, scenario `timing_stats`, `claimable_metrics`, and `unstable_metrics` | Measured-run count, discarded warmup count, timing dispersion, and release-claim eligibility. | Separates stable signal from local timing noise and blocks overclaiming. |
| scenario `validations` | Correctness checks for query, doctor, indexing, and incremental update evidence. | Ensures the benchmark measured successful behavior, not only elapsed time. |
| `comparison.regression_status`, `comparison.compatibility`, and `comparison.regression_thresholds` | Baseline delta assessment against tolerated noise plus comparable-environment checks. | Makes release comparisons actionable and CI-enforceable. |
| `environment`, `source_control`, and `benchmark_configuration` | Runtime, hardware, git commit/branch/dirty state, and protocol fingerprint for the report. | Makes benchmark evidence auditable and prevents anonymous timing artifacts. |
| sample repo SHA-256 fingerprints | Filtered sample repo content identity after ignored-directory policy is applied. | Prevents comparing different sample projects that happen to occupy the same sample slot. |
| baseline manifest | Versioned manifest for official files under `benchmarks/baselines/`, including schema, package version, source control, environment, samples, and summary. | Makes committed release baseline inventory reviewable without opening every JSON report. |
| trend report metrics | Direction-aware first/last deltas for targeted-context estimated-token avoidance, code index, incremental index, architecture report, and sample repo timings. | Finds gradual degradation that single baseline pass/fail may miss. |

## Measurement Rules

- Token estimates use `ceil(characters / 4)` for stable cross-version comparison without a tokenizer dependency; they are not measured LLM tokenizer counts or API token consumption.
- Actual LLM benchmark claims must not reuse the `ceil(characters / 4)` estimate as measured usage. They need an API-backed or Codex JSONL-backed run that records provider-returned token usage plus client-measured timing.
- Default context-efficiency savings compare full-wiki markdown scanning against startup/index plus the query-returned target document. Startup/index-only savings are retained only as an upper-bound field.
- Read timing is local wall-clock filesystem timing; compare only against baselines captured with matching schema, Node version, platform, architecture, scale, run count, warmup run count, measurement protocol, and scenario set.
- Large scale uses one discarded warmup run plus repeated measured runs by default; reported scenario timing metrics are medians and include dispersion statistics.
- Quick scale is a smoke/CI path for report shape, validation coverage, and gate wiring, not release evidence or a performance regression gate.
- Scenario correctness validations must be recorded per measured run. Claimable median metrics use only runs that pass correctness and measurement claimability. Measurement claimability requires provider usage fields, positive token counts, positive wall-clock timing, final text, and exactly one observed model; `median_all_runs` remains available for audit when any run fails, needs review, or lacks claimable measurement fields.
- Default large fixture sizes should stay stable across releases unless the benchmark schema version changes.
- Baseline regressions should be interpreted through schema v9 thresholds; use `--fail-on-regression` when benchmark comparison is part of a release gate.
- `--fail-on-regression` must fail when `comparison.regression_status` is `failed`, `unstable`, or `not_comparable`; only `passed` is release-claimable.
- `--fail-on-regression` requires `--baseline`; a release gate without a baseline is invalid.
- Release evidence that must prove clean-checkout provenance should use `--require-clean`.
- Saving a baseline requires a clean git checkout unless `--allow-dirty-baseline` is explicitly set for non-release validation.
- Release-gate comparisons run under `--require-clean` treat missing or dirty source-control provenance as not comparable.
- Scenario compatibility includes sample repo id, profile, content fingerprint, and fingerprint algorithm, not only scenario slot names.
- Release comparisons use strict compatibility checks, including exact Node/V8/environment fields when source-control strictness is requested.
- Trend reports preserve input order and use relaxed compatibility checks based on Node major version plus platform/architecture; incompatible inputs are excluded from metric deltas while still listed with compatibility issues. A metric needs at least two compatible numeric points before trend status is claimable.
- Timing claims must cite `measurement.claimable_metrics`; metrics listed in `measurement.unstable_metrics` require rerun or investigation before release claims.
- Claim stability checks use both coefficient of variation and an absolute timing range threshold, and each claim records min/median/max/range for review.
- Any public improvement claim should cite current report values and baseline delta, not only qualitative descriptions.
- Release notes may summarize the JSON, but the raw benchmark report should remain available for review.
- `benchmark:baseline` should be run to archive baseline evidence; `benchmark:release` should be run for gated current-vs-baseline release claims.
- Commit release baselines that public claims compare against; do not commit ad hoc current reports from local investigation.
- Claims should use the scenario-specific confidence boundary from the JSON. Default code-index throughput covers generated JS, TS, TSX, test TS, Go, Python, Rust, Java, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, C, C++, C#, YAML, JSON, package metadata, package-lock, and ignored-directory fixture files; Tree-sitter metrics are reported separately.
- `--sample-repo` metrics are observational evidence for the explicit local repository paths only. Do not use sample repositories as a general large-project claim without also citing the synthetic suite, sample paths, and repo profiles.
- Ad hoc current reports under `benchmarks/reports/*.json` and `benchmarks/reports/*.md` are ignored by default; commit only deliberate release evidence summaries or baselines.
- Official release baselines must be generated from a clean checkout with the standard sample set. If a locally generated baseline reports `source_control.dirty: true`, treat it as implementation evidence until regenerated clean for public release claims.

## Actual LLM Subscription Benchmark Surface

Adopted direction:

- Add a separate opt-in benchmark surface for ChatGPT/Codex-authenticated real LLM measurements instead of mixing these results into the existing deterministic maintainer benchmark.
- Use only Codex CLI for the subscription-authenticated benchmark path. Do not use OpenCode, OpenClaw, or other third-party coding-agent adapters for official project benchmark evidence.
- Primary local path is `codex exec --json` with saved ChatGPT/Codex authentication, because it emits machine-readable turn events with provider-returned usage fields while avoiding direct OpenAI Platform API billing.
- Initial implementation includes dry-run fixture manifests, Codex JSONL parsing, expectation-based correctness checks, sample measured-report validation, and gated measured execution through `benchmarks/codex-llm-metrics.js`. Measured Codex execution requires `--allow-codex-run` and defaults to one with/without pair to preserve comparison validity while limiting subscription quota use.
- Required actual LLM fields: `input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `reasoning_output_tokens` when available, `total_tokens` or derived total, wall-clock duration, first-token latency when stream events expose it, tokens/sec, request/turn count, model, auth mode, and run timestamp.
- Cost fields for subscription-authenticated runs should be labeled as `subscription_usage`, `credit_usage`, or `not_priced`, depending on what Codex exposes. Do not calculate dollar API cost unless the run used an API key or a documented token-to-credit rate card that applies to that auth mode.
- Scenarios should be small and reproducible: fixed prompts against generated wiki fixtures, no repository writes, no external web/tool dependencies, and low run counts by default. Release evidence can increase repetitions only when the user explicitly accepts subscription quota consumption.
- Claims must distinguish three categories: deterministic Markdown context estimate, subscription-authenticated real token/latency measurement, and API-key-priced token/cost measurement.
- Official actual-LLM comparison must be a with/without Project Librarian experiment across small, medium, and large wiki/codebase fixtures. The control condition should omit generated `wiki/startup.md`, `wiki/index.md`, hooks, and code-evidence routing while preserving equivalent repository content needed to answer the task. The treatment condition should use the Project Librarian startup/index routing and optional code-evidence surfaces.
- Scenario prompts should reproduce real agent work, not synthetic token counting alone. Required task families: project onboarding summary, find the current decision/source of truth, answer a code-impact question, locate release/verification policy, and diagnose where a change should be made. Write-changing tasks require a disposable fixture and must report changed-file count; read-only tasks should assert zero file changes.
- Required comparison dimensions: `scale` (`small`, `medium`, `large`), `condition` (`with_project_librarian`, `without_project_librarian`), `task_family`, `prompt_id`, `model`, `auth_mode`, token usage, wall-clock duration, first-token timing when available, Codex turn count, total JSONL item count, command/tool call counts by event type, files read or referenced when observable, final answer correctness, and evidence-citation correctness.
- Tool-call metrics should be derived from Codex JSONL events, including command executions, MCP/tool events, file-change events, plan events, and errors when present. Event counts and normalized invocation counts must be reported separately so start/completed JSONL pairs do not inflate tool-call claims. If a Codex event type does not expose enough detail to count a tool category, the report must mark that field as unavailable instead of estimating silently.
- Public claims from actual-LLM benchmarks should report medians and dispersion by scale and condition, plus with-vs-without deltas. They must not substitute deterministic Markdown token estimates for measured Codex usage.

Concrete implementation plan:

- Add a new runner instead of extending `benchmarks/project-metrics.js`: `benchmarks/codex-llm-metrics.js` for CLI/report writing, `benchmarks/lib/codex-jsonl.js` for JSONL parsing, `benchmarks/lib/llm-fixtures.js` for paired fixture materialization, `benchmarks/lib/llm-correctness.js` for expectation-based answer checks, and `tests/validators/codex-llm-benchmark-smoke.js` for report validation.
- Add npm scripts: `benchmark:llm` for the opt-in LLM benchmark surface, `benchmark:llm:dry-run` for fixture/manifest generation without launching Codex, and `benchmark:llm:parse-smoke` for parser/report-shape validation over checked-in sample JSONL fixtures.
- Matrix: every official report should cover `small`, `medium`, and `large` scales; `with_project_librarian` and `without_project_librarian` conditions; and task families `onboarding`, `decision_lookup`, `code_impact`, `release_policy`, and `change_location`.
- Fixture sizing: small means about 8-20 planning pages and 50-150 source/config files; medium means about 80-160 planning pages and 500-1,000 source/config files; large means 500+ planning pages and 1,500+ source/config files with monorepo-shaped apps/packages/services.
- Treatment condition: bootstrap the fixture with Project Librarian and keep generated `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.codex/hooks/wiki-session-start.js`, `wiki/startup.md`, `wiki/index.md`, canonical/decision/source/meta pages, scoped routers, and optional `.project-wiki/code-evidence.sqlite`.
- Control condition: preserve equivalent repository facts and source files, but remove Project Librarian routing/evidence surfaces such as generated startup/index routing, Project Librarian hook config, scoped routers, and `.project-wiki` code evidence. Keep normal project materials such as README, package files, source files, and scattered docs.
- Measured command shape: `codex exec --json --ephemeral --sandbox read-only "<prompt>"` from the fixture root. The runner must require explicit `--allow-codex-run` before launching Codex and should refuse measured subscription mode when `CODEX_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present unless `--auth-mode api-key` is explicitly requested.
- Raw artifacts: write JSONL under `benchmarks/reports/llm/raw/` and aggregate JSON/Markdown under `benchmarks/reports/llm/`. Treat ad hoc LLM reports like other local benchmark reports: do not commit unless deliberately preserving release evidence.
- Report schema v1: top-level fields should include `schema_version`, `benchmark_kind: "codex-actual-llm"`, `auth_mode`, auth audit metadata, `generated_at`, `environment`, `codex`, `configuration`, `summary`, and `scenarios`. Summary records `comparison_pair_count` so validators can prove selected scenarios form complete with/without pairs. Each scenario should include `scale`, `condition`, `task_family`, `prompt_id`, `model`, `models`, `runs`, claimable-run `median`, `median_all_runs`, `passed_run_count`, `claimable_run_count`, `correctness`, and `raw_jsonl_paths`. Each run records correctness plus measurement claimability. Validators must reparse raw JSONL paths and recompute run metrics, correctness, measurement claimability, comparison pair count, and medians before accepting measured reports.
- Required parsed metrics: `input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `reasoning_output_tokens`, derived `total_tokens`, `wall_ms`, `tokens_per_second`, `codex_turn_count`, `jsonl_event_count`, `command_event_count`, `command_invocation_count`, `tool_event_count`, `tool_invocation_count`, `mcp_event_count`, `mcp_invocation_count`, `file_change_event_count`, `error_event_count`, model metadata, and `unavailable_event_fields`.
- Correctness checks: the current checker keeps task expectations in `benchmarks/lib/llm-correctness.js` and validates required terms, forbidden terms, expected evidence paths, read-only zero file changes, and missing final text. Validators must recalculate correctness from run metrics rather than trusting stored report status. Public improvement percentages should exclude `needs_review` cases unless manually adjudicated and documented.
- Implementation phases: dry-run, parser, sample measured-report validation, correctness checks, gated measured execution, paired with/without selection, and claimable-run median gating are implemented. Remaining phases are full scale/task matrix, stronger real-event taxonomy from raw Codex JSONL, optional expectation-file extraction, Markdown summary, and README claim policy.
- Verification: non-Codex checks are `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run unit`, `node benchmarks/codex-llm-metrics.js --dry-run`, `node tests/validators/codex-llm-benchmark-smoke.js <sample-report.json>`, and `npm run benchmark:llm:parse-smoke`; measured verification starts with one small with/without pair and confirms raw JSONL, parsed usage, correctness, and clean read-only fixture state.

## Roadmap Measurement Gates

- Incremental code evidence index: implemented. Report code-index wall time, files/sec, changed-file reindex count, deleted-file count, and full rebuild comparison before claiming improvement.
- Multi-language parser backend: synthetic benchmark fixture now includes JS/TS/TSX/Python/Go/Rust/Java/PHP/Kotlin/Swift/C/C++/C# files and separate Tree-sitter parser-profile metrics. Continue to report extraction coverage by language, parser failures, index time, and symbol/import/edge counts before making broader parser claims.
- Architecture and ownership summaries: implemented inside the code-heavy benchmark. Report `architecture_report_ms`, section count, populated evidence table count, route coverage, and dependency hotspot coverage before claiming report performance.
- Workspace graph summaries: implemented in `--code-report` and `--code-report-section workspace-graph`. Report workspace count, package managers, lockfiles, internal dependency edges, and external dependency hotspots before claiming monorepo dependency-graph support.
- Monorepo-aware routing: report targeted context token size by scope and compare each scope against full wiki plus full repository wiki reads.

## Current Clean Local Large Benchmark

- Latest clean local report: `benchmarks/reports/current-large.json` and `benchmarks/reports/current-large.md`, generated 2026-06-09T08:08:07.238Z.
- Observed with Node v22.19.0/V8 12.4.254.21-node.29 on darwin arm64, Apple M4 Pro, 14 CPUs, 24,576MB memory.
- Source-control fingerprint in the local generated file: commit `18e730882c4f`, branch `main`, `dirty: false`, 0 status entries. This is clean local release evidence for README benchmark values.
- Large assumptions: 500 varied docs-heavy wiki pages, 40 monorepo workspaces across apps/packages/services/libs, 720 scoped-router pages, 1,608 mixed code fixture files, and 3 repo-local standard sample repositories.
- Benchmark schema: v9 with 1 discarded warmup run and 5 repeated measured runs; timing status was `stable`.
- Claimable metrics in that run: 21. Unstable metrics: none.
- Targeted retrieval vs naive full-wiki scan Markdown context-size estimate avoidance: minimum 99.43%, median 99.61%.
- Read-time reduction: minimum 99.26%, median 99.47%.
- Retrieval correctness: 4/4 passed; targeted-context missing evidence files: 0.
- Scoped router: 720 pages, 13 generated routers, 67.684ms refresh-index time, 4,197-char main index.
- Full code index: 1,608 files at 4,781.27 files/sec, 336.312ms median.
- Incremental code index: 2 reindexed files, 186.776ms, 45.52% less wall-clock time than the full code-index run in the same fixture.
- Architecture/ownership report: 251.175ms, 10 sections, 6 populated evidence tables, 24 routes, 48 dependency hotspot entries.
- Tree-sitter code index: 1,608 files, 626.969ms, 14 parser profiles. Tree-sitter architecture report timing was stable at 254.092ms.
- Standard sample repos: 3 repos, 16 indexed files total, median sample code-index time 132.363ms, median sample architecture report time 135.694ms, 4 total routes, 5 dependency hotspot entries.
- Sample profiles: `01-web-service:web-routes+package-dependencies+config-bearing+symbol-bearing+mixed-language`, `02-python-cli:config-bearing+symbol-bearing+mixed-language+library-or-tooling`, and `03-mixed-monorepo:web-routes+package-dependencies+config-bearing+symbol-bearing+monorepo-shaped+mixed-language`.
- Release claims from the current harness require `measurement.timing_status: stable`, an empty `measurement.unstable_metrics`, and `comparison.regression_status: passed` when a baseline is supplied.

## Historical Local Large Benchmark

- The older `benchmarks/reports/0.1.2-large.json` snapshot used pre-schema-v9 evidence and should not be reused for current README or release claims.
- Retain that snapshot only as historical context. Public README benchmark values should use the current local large report or a clean release baseline generated after it.

## README Presentation Policy

- Public README benchmark content should be phrased as observed maintainer evidence, not as a user instruction to run benchmark commands.
- If the latest available report has `source_control.dirty: true`, disclose it as local validation evidence and avoid presenting it as clean release-gate evidence.
- User-facing benchmark summaries should include the main values readers need before methodology details: Markdown context-size estimate avoidance from targeted retrieval vs naive full-wiki scan, read-time reduction, measured wiki page count, code-index files/time/throughput, incremental update time/reduction, architecture report time/evidence, run count, warmup count, timing status, and unstable metric status.
- Benchmark command examples belong in maintainer/development sections or `benchmarks/README.md`, not in the primary product value section.
